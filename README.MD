# GMLZARI
GameMaker DLL for the purposes of dealing with files compressed using the **LZARI** algorithm, such as those present in SimTunes' "TUNERES.DAT".

## Where is the download?
Compiled examples are in the repo - the yyz for modern 64-bit GameMaker, the .gmz for 32-bit Studio 1.4. I'm not providing pre-Studio GM builds at this time, but I believe they will function if you manually import the scripts.
